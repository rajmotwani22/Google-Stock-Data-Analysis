#The standardized residuals graph shows that the residuals are generally within the 3 standard deviation band, which means that they are not unusual. However, there are a few outliers, which suggests that the ARIMA model may not be perfectly capturing all of the structure in the data from 2018 to 2023.
#The ACF graph shows that the correlation coefficients at all lags are within the 95% confidence interval, which means that they are not statistically significant. 
#The p-values for the Ljung-Box statistic are all greater than 0.05, which suggests that the residuals are not serially correlated.
